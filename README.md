🔌 I’m a recent Electronics & Communication graduate from Tamil Nadu, India, with a passion for writing software that makes hardware perform at its best — **fast, bug-free, and in real time**.

💡 My interest in embedded systems sparked while watching the incredible work of *Mecha Comet* and diving deep into how processors really work. Since then, I've been building projects that connect code with circuits — creating systems that are both efficient and intelligent.

### 🛠️ Projects That Define Me
- 🔁 **NAND Flash Memory Simulator with Wear Leveling**  
  Simulated NAND flash memory in C with dynamic wear leveling, realistic block management, and error handling.  
  *📦 C, Memory Algorithms, Embedded Simulation*

- ⚡ **Buck-Boost DC-DC Converter for EVs**  
  Designed a PID-A controlled converter using Raspberry Pi and Proteus, targeting real-world EV voltage challenges.  
  *📦 Python, Raspberry Pi, Proteus, Power Electronics*

- 🧠 **LLVM Pass for ARM Optimization**  
  Developed a custom LLVM pass to reduce ARM Cortex-M code size and improve runtime — tested on STM32 with QEMU.  
  *📦 C++, LLVM IR, GCC Toolchain, STM32*

- 🌐 **TCP Chat System**  
  Built a threaded, multi-client real-time chat system with proper nickname management and graceful disconnects.  
  *📦 Python, Sockets, Threading*

- ⏱️ **[In Progress] Bare-Metal RTOS**  
  Writing a minimal RTOS from scratch — focusing on cooperative scheduling, task switching, and system tick management.  
  *📦 C, ARM Assembly, Memory Maps*
